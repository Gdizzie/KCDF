*** URG! ASSETS FOR UNITY 3.5 ***
*** THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE A COPY OF THE CONTENT FROM URG SITE ***

In the case that URG! is going to be used in a 3.5 release, follow these steps for proper installation:

1- Backup the original project (the whole project folder, not just the asset folder)
2- Access the asset store, begin import of the URG! package, and please wait until the import file selection appears
3- When the file import window comes up, press NONE at the bottom, and only select the last file in the list, which is URG's latest version for Unity 3.5
4- Double click on the new file in the project
5- Complete the new asset import process, and the latest URG version is now available. Have fun creating awesome ragdolls!
